We plan to use Psychtoolbox to gauge sadness levels of people when seeing climate vs non-climate related images, and ask them questions about their immediate climate vulnerability, to determine whether there is a relationship between someone’s level of concern for climate issues and the level at which they are impacted by it. 
By flashing various distressing images, some being climate related, and asking subjects to rank their distress levels, we can ascertain the level of sadness that climate change brings to individuals in comparison to other non-climate related problems. 
Our results will hopefully help us to understand how climate advocates can target people who aren’t affected by climate change, and people who are differently, to create more effective advocacy campaigns. Our results could also help show the need for more mental health professionals in areas highly vulnerable to climate change effects, demonstrating the relationship between the physical impacts of climate change and heightened mental distress.
